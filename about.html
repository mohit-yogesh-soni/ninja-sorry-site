    <h2>Dear ❤️,</h2>
    <p>
	  I found a loop hole, If I can't say it I can write it:
      I’m truly sorry for what happened. I never meant to hurt you.
	  I was just not okay that you are always priortizing friends over me
	  but now I have realize that I need to earn it not ask for it, next
	  time won't be angry on for something I should work on, please don't be 
	  mad at me, and send me your address itna kya naraz hone ka moturam
	  
      Please know that you matter more to me than any silly mistake.  
      Let's be okay again? 🥺
    </p>
